## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs a comparative analysis of various machine learning models using the **Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset**. The goal is to predict whether a visitor will generate revenue (make a purchase) based on their browsing behavior and session details.

 The project covers the entire data science pipeline, including:
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
* **Model Implementation:** Training multiple ML algorithms.
* **Evaluation:** Comparing models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* **Visualization:** Detailed ROC Curves and Confusion Matrices to visualize performance.
